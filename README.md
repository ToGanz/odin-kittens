Project 1: Building a Simple Kittens API
This is a fast and straightforward project where I’ll set up a Rails app to be a data-producing API… which is just a fancy way of saying that all the controller methods will render data instead of HTML. I consider this a drill in quickly building a pure vanilla RESTful resource. I won’t be working with an external API until the second project.
